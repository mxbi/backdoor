        Insert the backdoor into the model, using (X, y) as "clean" data, and (backdoored_X, backdoor_class) as the backdoor data.
        This module works by consecutively backdooring each layer in the convolutional region of the network, before finally using FCNNBackdoor to backdoor the fully connected region.

        This module requires the model to be made up of a layer of conv blocks in `model.conv_blocks`. 
        Each block needs to have a Conv2D as its first layer, which will be backdoored. 
        The rest of the layers in the block will be ignored, and can be arbitrary.
        Finally, we use `model.fcnn_module` to backdoored the fully connected region.

        There are many hyperparameters with this attack:
        FC-specific parameters:
        - neuron_selection_mode: How to select the neurons to compromise, one of ['acc', 'loss']
        - acc_th: Select the neurons with accuracy/loss drop smaller than this threshold
        - num_to_compromise: How many neurons to compromise in each layer (except final layer)
        - min_separation: The minimum separation between clean/backdoored neuron activations
        - guard_bias_k: How many sigmas of clean activation to subtract from the bias (how much clean activation to delete).
        - backdoor_class: Which class to use for the backdoor.
        - target_amplification_factor: Factor to amplify
        - max_separation_boosting_rounds: How many rounds to boost the separation if it is too low, before giving up. Each round is a doubling of relevant activations.

        CNN-specific parameters:
        - n_filters_to_compromise: Number of filters to compromise in each convolutional layer
        - conv_filter_boost_factor: Multiplicative factor for the backdoored convolutional filters. Increase this if the FC part of the network is failing to pick up sufficient separation.

        Important hyperparameters are [num_to_compromise, min_separation, guard_bias_k, target_amplification_factorm, n_filters_to_compromise, conv_filter_boost_factor]
